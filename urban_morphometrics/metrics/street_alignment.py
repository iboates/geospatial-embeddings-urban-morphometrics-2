"""Street alignment metric.

Deviation between each building's orientation and the orientation of its
nearest street segment. Low values indicate buildings parallel or perpendicular
to the street grid; high values indicate organic or irregular placement.

Each building is matched to its nearest street using momepy.get_nearest_street.
Buildings farther than street_alignment_max_distance (configurable via
MetricConfig, default 500 m) from any street receive a NaN value and are
excluded from cell-level aggregation.

Requires neighbourhood context so both buildings and streets near the cell
boundary can find their true nearest counterparts.

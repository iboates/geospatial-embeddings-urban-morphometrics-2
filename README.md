# Urban Morphometrics

Computes urban morphology metrics for a gridded study area from OpenStreetMap data. Each grid cell is characterised by ~47 aggregated metrics covering building dimensions, shape, spatial distribution, street relationships, and street network connectivity.

## Installation

```bash
poetry install
```

## Running

### Command line

```bash
python run.py STUDY_AREA PBF_PATH RUN_NAME OUTPUT_FOLDER [options]
```

Or after install:

```bash
urban-morphometrics STUDY_AREA PBF_PATH RUN_NAME OUTPUT_FOLDER [options]
```

|---|---|
| `STUDY_AREA` | Path to study area file (GeoPackage / GeoJSON / Shapefile) in WGS84 with a `region_id` column or index |

| `--debug` | off | Dump intermediate OSM layers to `OUTPUT_FOLDER/RUN_NAME/debug/` |
| `--no-cache` | off | Recompute every cell, ignoring and not writing the metric cache |
| `--metric-config PATH` | — | Path to a JSON config file (see below) |

**Example:**

```bash
urban-morphometrics study_area.gpkg city.osm.pbf run_2024 outputs/ \
    --neighbourhood-distance 300 \
    --metrics degree,meshedness_global,floor_area \
    --metric-config config.json
```

### Python API

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from urban_morphometrics.main import compute_urban_morphometrics

study_area = gpd.read_file("study_area.gpkg").set_index("region_id")

compute_urban_morphometrics(
    study_area_gdf=study_area,
    pbf_path="city.osm.pbf",
    run_name="my_run",
    output_folder="outputs/",
    neighbourhood_distance=500,
    num_quantiles=10,
    metrics=["floor_area", "degree", "meshedness_global"],  # or None for all
    metric_config={"knn_k": 10, "network_subgraph_radius": 3},
)
```

## Output

Results are written to `OUTPUT_FOLDER/RUN_NAME/results/metrics.gpkg` — a GeoPackage with one row per study area cell and one column per metric statistic. For distributed metrics the columns follow the pattern `{metric}_{stat}` where `stat` is `mean`, `median`, `std`, or `q{percentile}` (e.g. `floor_area_mean`, `degree_vehicle_q90`). Graph-level metrics produce a single column per network type (e.g. `meshedness_global_vehicle`).

Intermediate data (per-cell projected GeoDataFrames, tessellations) is cached to `OUTPUT_FOLDER/RUN_NAME/cache/{region_id}/` as Parquet files so the pipeline can resume after interruption.

## Metric config

Computational parameters can be tuned via a JSON file passed with `--metric-config` (CLI) or as a dict via `metric_config=` (API). All keys are optional; omitted keys use the defaults shown below.

```json
{
    "knn_k": 15,
    "tessellation_buffer": "adaptive",
    "tessellation_min_buffer": 0.0,
    "tessellation_max_buffer": 100.0,
    "tessellation_shrink": 0.4,
    "tessellation_segment": 0.5,
    "street_alignment_max_distance": 500.0,
    "network_subgraph_radius": 5,
    "street_profile_distance": 10.0,
    "street_profile_tick_length": 50.0
}
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `knn_k` | 15 | Nearest neighbours for KNN graphs (alignment, building_adjacency, mean_interbuilding_distance) |
| `tessellation_buffer` | `"adaptive"` | Clip buffer for Voronoi tessellation. `"adaptive"` uses momepy's Gabriel-graph heuristic; pass a float for a fixed distance in metres |
| `tessellation_min_buffer` | 0.0 | Minimum clip buffer (m) when `tessellation_buffer` is `"adaptive"` |
| `tessellation_max_buffer` | 100.0 | Maximum clip buffer (m) when `tessellation_buffer` is `"adaptive"` |
| `tessellation_shrink` | 0.4 | Negative buffer (m) applied to each building before Voronoi to create a gap between cells |
| `tessellation_segment` | 0.5 | Maximum point spacing (m) during polygon discretisation; smaller = more precise but slower |
| `street_alignment_max_distance` | 500.0 | Maximum search radius (m) for nearest-street matching. Set to `null` for no limit |
| `network_subgraph_radius` | 5 | Hop radius for local subgraph metrics: meshedness, gamma, edge_node_ratio, cyclomatic, mean_node_degree |
| `street_profile_distance` | 10.0 | Spacing (m) between perpendicular ticks when measuring street profiles |
| `street_profile_tick_length` | 50.0 | Length (m) of each tick; should exceed the widest expected street canyon |
